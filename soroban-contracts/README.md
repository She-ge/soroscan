# Soroban Contracts

This folder contains all Soroban smart contracts for SoroScan.

## Contracts

### soroscan_core

The core contract that:
- Accepts event submissions from authorized indexers
- Emits standardized events for off-chain consumption
- Stores event counters and latest events by type

## Building

```bash
cd soroscan_core
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

## Testing

The contract includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

- **Initialization**: deploy and init with admin, double-init prevention
- **Access control**: admin vs non-admin indexer management
- **Event recording**: whitelisted indexer records, non-whitelisted rejection
- **Indexer lifecycle**: add, verify, remove indexer
- **SC-38 structured events**: schema-version validation and correlation-ID deduplication

Run all tests:

```bash
cd soroscan_core
cargo test
```

Expected output: all tests passing with no warnings.

## SC-38 structured events

`record_structured_event` adds an opt-in, backward-compatible event format. It
accepts the existing contract ID, event type, and SHA-256 payload hash plus a
non-zero `schema_version` and a 32-byte `correlation_id`. The correlation ID is
stored and rejects retries that would otherwise publish a duplicate event.

The Python and TypeScript SDKs expose this as `record_structured_event` and
`recordStructuredEvent`; both submit to `POST /api/record/structured/`.

## Deploying to Testnet

```bash
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroscan_core.wasm \
  --source <YOUR_SECRET_KEY> \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Network ; September 2015"
```
